### Methods

`init(path_to_script)`

Creates the WebWorker using the supplied javascrip script file.

- *e.g. './assets/js/worker.js*

*Note: The `worker` class provides a wrapper for Worker script files. These files must be valid javascript worker files.*

---

`postMessage(msg)`

Send message to worker script. Use this to control worker script operation.

---

`terminate()`

Terminate the worker immediately.

---

### Events

The following STREAM events are exposed for the purposes of interacting with the worker script:

- `onMessage`: Raised when a message is received from the worker.

- `onError`: Raised upon an error event in the worker.



Subscribe to these events to interact with the worker script.

*Example:*

```
this.sk.worker.onMessage.subscribe( e=> {
    ...
}); 
this.sk.worker.onError.subscribe( e=> {
    ...
});
```
